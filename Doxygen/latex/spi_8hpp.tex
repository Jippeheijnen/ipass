This is my S\+PI bus implementation. Other than hwlib this class uses the cs pin as well. The M\+I\+SO pin, since no reading is required, is left out.

\subsection{Detailed Description}
This is my S\+PI bus implementation. Other than hwlib this class uses the cs pin as well. The M\+I\+SO pin, since no reading is required, is left out. 

S\+PI transaction class. This class creates a transaction from a \hyperlink{classspi_1_1bus}{spi\+::bus}. In the constructor the CS pin is set to high, and in the destructor the CS pin is set to low to mark the end of the transaction.
