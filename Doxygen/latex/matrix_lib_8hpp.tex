\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains Library classes. I have created a library which suoports a matrix of L\+E\+Ds with a size of 16x24, controlled by a H\+T1632 chip. 

\hyperlink{classmatrix_1_1matrix_window}{matrix\+::matrix\+Window} This class is a way to use my matrices as hwlib\+::window\textquotesingle{}s. The cool part about this is that you can use a matrix\+Window to draw hwlib\+::drawable\textquotesingle{}s. Apart from the constructor, I won\textquotesingle{}t go into depth how the class works because it basically is a hwlib\+::window. The functions are mostly self-\/explanatory.

\hyperlink{classmatrix_1_1_h_t__1632}{matrix\+::\+H\+T\+\_\+1632} This is the library part of my i\+Pass project. The matrix is 16 x 32 in size, and it is controlled by an H\+T1632 chip. This chip works with spi so thats why I created a spi implementation as well.

\hyperlink{structmatrix_1_1commands}{matrix\+::commands} These command codes are used to initiate the matrix so that the H\+T1632 chip knows what it needs to do and what it\textquotesingle{}s task is.
